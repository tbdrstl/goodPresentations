# Good Presentations
There are many occasions where you have to listen to talks or even give them yourself. 

Throughout many conferences, seminars and lectures, some patterns emerged on what differentiates good from bad talks. 
The following is a loose collection of Dos and Don'ts when giving a talk. The list is far from complete, so **you are highly invited to make further suggestions!**

1. Never let the audience think you are bored by your topic. Especially when researching a topic for months, many crucial things seem obvious to you, and most likely, most of your audience will hear them for the first time

2. Finding the right point to start your presentation is crucial. What can you expect your audience to know and what do you have to explain? (in physics this is mostly just basic quantum and statistical mechanics)

3. If you need a laser pointer for your presentation it is bad. The slides should designed or presented in such a way that it is always clear what you are referring to.

4. Practice your talk! Know what you want to say and don't let the next slide tell you. Smaller talks of up to 30 minutes can be practised so often that you remember the crucial formulations. For any longer talk, you should prepare notes with the central talking points.

5. Don't zap through your slides to answer questions. PPT and Keynote provide tools to switch to any slide immediately. 

6. It is fine to finish early. Don't squece a new, complicated topic at the last minute.

7. If you can not visualize a calculation, it is not important for your talk. Theorem: with enough willpower, every relevant calculation can be visualized.

8. Calculations and code only belong to the presentation if they are vital for understanding. You can rarely judge whether your own computations or code are relevant. Rule of thumb: No.

9. Plots: they should look nice. Adjusting the font size to match the presentation/paper font can largely improve them. Also, the font has to be of readable size.

10. False ends you went after are only interesting if something new came out of it. 

11. German scientists sometimes seem to struggle with the words "examine", "advantageous" and "determine". Here is how to pronounce them correctly: `/ɪgˈzæm.ɪn/`, `/ˌæd.vænˈteɪ.dʒəs/`, `/dɪˈtɜː.mɪn/`

12. A talk is mainly about selling yourself and your ideas. You shouldn't talk down your results by stressing how different people researched similar topics. If what you have been doing is not new or important, why should people even listen?
